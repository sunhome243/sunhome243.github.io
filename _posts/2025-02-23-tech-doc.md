## Overview

This document describes the **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** architecture for an IoT voice command application. The goal is to **rapidly** develop a low-cost, serverless solution that allows users to:

- Register and connect their Arduino devices via Wi-Fi (using a UUID).
- Send voice commands (up to 10 seconds) through a web frontend.
- Have the backend process these commands using a third-party AI service (“Gemini API”).
- Return the processed result to both the **web frontend** and the **Arduino** in (near) real-time via WebSocket.

Because this is an MVP, **minimal security** and authentication are implemented. We use **Arduino UUID + PIN** to authenticate requests. In a production environment, this will be replaced or augmented by more robust solutions (like **AWS Cognito** or JWT tokens).

All AWS services are placed in a **public subnet** for simplicity and cost reasons, with the understanding that this might not be optimal for production but is sufficient for our low-traffic MVP. To mitigate certain security risks, we strictly manage IAM policies and ensure S3 is **not publicly accessible**.

---

## Key Requirements & Considerations

1. **Fast Development**

   - Prioritize a minimal and straightforward architecture to speed up development.

2. **Low Cost**

   - Leverage serverless AWS services (Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, API Gateway) within Free Tier thresholds where possible.

3. **Traffic Pattern**

   - The application does **not** expect constant traffic. Hence, serverless pay-per-invocation is cost-effective.

4. **Security**

   - MVP-level security with a simple `(Arduino UUID, PIN)` check.
   - Acknowledged risk of replay attacks, plaintext credential, client-side storage exploit, and lack of access controls for device commands.
   - Planned upgrade to more robust security (e.g., Cognito) at production scale.

5. **Data Sensitivity**
   - Some potential PII in the voice recordings/results.
   - Use **S3 Server-Side Encryption (SSE)** and strict IAM policies to protect any saved JSON results.

## High-Level Architecture Diagram

1. **Frontend** calls REST API with voice data, Arduino UUID, and PIN.
2. **LLM Orchestration Lambda** checks DynamoDB to validate `(UUID, PIN)`.
3. **Gemini API** processes the audio and returns a JSON result.
4. The result JSON is stored in **S3** (SSE encryption).
5. **LLM Orchestration Lambda** fetches `connectionId` for that `UUID` from DynamoDB, uses **API Gateway WebSocket** to send success message to Arduino and also a separate message to the **Frontend**.

## AWS Components

### 1. DynamoDB

- **auth table**:

  - **Schema**: `arduino_uuid (String)` as primary key, and `pin (Number)`
  - Stores the credential-like data for a quick authentication check.
  - **Note**: PIN is stored in plaintext (MVP). Vulnerable to replay attacks.

- **websocket table**:

  - **Schema**: `arduino_uuid (String)` as primary key, `connection_id (String)`
  - Maps the Arduino’s UUID to its current WebSocket connection ID.
  - Whenever the Arduino reconnects, overwrite the existing connection ID.

- **device info table** (Referenced only if needed by the specific use case, e.g., for RGB color mode):
  - **Schema**: depends on the device type (e.g., `device_type` as a key, and stored preset color codes, ir_code, etc.)
  - Used to look up preset color codes for specific device types.

### 2. API Gateway

- **REST API**:

  - Handles the HTTP(S) calls from the web frontend (voice data, UUID, PIN).
  - Integrates with the **LLM Orchestration Lambda** (proxy integration).

- **WebSocket API**:
  - Maintains real-time connections to Arduino devices.
  - Allows backend to push messages/commands via `connectionId`.

### 3. AWS Lambda (LLM Orchestration Lambda)

- Receives voice commands from API Gateway (REST).
- Validates `(UUID, PIN)` via DynamoDB (`auth table`).
- Stores the voice data in memory or temporary `/tmp` folder.
- Invokes **Gemini API** with the audio data:
  - **Timeout**: Retries up to 3 times.
  - On failure, sends a “failure message” back to the frontend and optionally to the Arduino.
- Receives the JSON response from Gemini, saves it to **S3** (`user/{arduino_uuid}` folder).
- If RGB mode, retrieve preset color code that is closest to our RGB code and calculate how much should R, G, B be incremented and decremented.
- Uses `uuid -> connection_id` from `websocket table` to `postToConnection` on the WebSocket API (message to Arduino).
- Additionally sends a message to the frontend to inform status/progress.

### 4. Amazon S3

- **Bucket Structure**: `user/{arduino_id}/...`
- **Server-Side Encryption**: SSE-S3 to ensure data at rest is encrypted.
- **Access**: Bucket is **not** publicly accessible; strict IAM policy allows only the Lambda role to write/read.

### 5. Arduino Device

- Connects to **Wi-Fi** using a known SSID/password (manually configured for MVP).
- On startup:
  1. Opens a WebSocket connection to the `API Gateway (WS URL)`.
  2. Sends its `arduino_uuid` to register the connection ID in DynamoDB.
- Receives real-time messages from the backend.
- When it receives the final JSON or command, it checks if the `uuid` is correct and performs the IR transmitter logic to control an LED strip (or other hardware-specific action).

---

## Detailed Main feature Flow

### 1. Arduino WebSocket Connection

1. **Arduino boots** and joins the school Wi-Fi (manually configured).
2. **Arduino** opens a **WebSocket** connection to `wss://{api_gateway_websocket_url}`.
3. Upon connection, it **immediately sends** its `arduino_uuid`.
4. **API Gateway (WS)** triggers a small Lambda (or integration) that **stores** the `(arduino_uuid, connection_id)` pair into the **websocket table** in DynamoDB.
   - If the `arduino_uuid` already exists, the `connection_id` is **overwritten**.

### 2. Frontend REST Request for Voice Commands

1. **Prerequisite**:

   - The user has already entered their **Arduino UUID + PIN + Device Type** on the frontend.
   - The frontend stores these credentials locally (e.g., in localStorage).
   - **Security Trade-off**: Less secure but acceptable for an MVP.

2. **User Action**:

   - The user records (or selects) an audio file (max 10 seconds).

3. **HTTP Request**:
   - The frontend sends a `POST` request to the **API Gateway (REST)** including:
     - Audio file (binary or base64-encoded)
     - `arduino_uuid`
     - `pin`
     - `Device Type`

### 3. Backend Processing

#### 1. Invocation

- **LLM Orchestration Lambda** is invoked with:
  - The audio file
  - `uuid`
  - `pin`
  - `Device Type`

#### 2. Authentication

- **LLM Orchestration Lambda** queries the `auth table` to verify that `(uuid, pin)` is valid.
  - **If invalid**:
    - Returns a `401` error (or another error) to the frontend.

#### 3. Audio Storage

- **If authentication is successful**:
  - Temporarily store the audio either in memory or in the `/tmp` directory.

#### 4. Audio Processing via Gemini API

- **Lambda** calls the external **Gemini API** to process the audio:
  - **Request Timeout**: 10 seconds.
  - **Retry Mechanism**: Up to 3 retries if the call fails or times out.
  - **Failure Handling**:
    - If all retries fail, the Lambda sends a “failure message” back to the frontend (and Arduino if needed).

#### 5. Success Handling from Gemini API

- **Upon receiving a successful JSON response**:

  1. **Save the JSON** to **S3** at `user/{arduino_uuid}/...`, with server-side encryption.
  2. **Check if the command indicates `RGB/dynamicMode` with `RGB` selected**:
     - If yes, then:
       1. Query the **device table** in DynamoDB with **device_type (primary key)** and **id (partition key)** by the device type to get the IR code.
       2. Get all required IR code (Power, red code up, etc.)
       3. Prepare these adjustment details for the next step (e.g., pass them along in the final command to Arduino).
  3. **Retrieve the `connection_id`** from the **websocket table** by matching the `arduino_uuid`.
  4. **Send a WebSocket message** (via `postToConnection`) to the **Arduino**, indicating success and including either the final JSON or the relevant command details.
  5. **Send a separate message** or HTTP response to the **Frontend** to update the status (e.g., “Processing complete, AI found the correct command.”).

#### 6. Frontend and UI Updates

- **Frontend**:

  - Receives the success/failure message from the Lambda (via REST response or an additional WebSocket channel).
  - Displays status messages (e.g., “Processing complete...”).

- **UI**:
  - May display a “Completed!” notification that auto-hides after a few seconds.

---

## Arduino Device Action

1. Once the **Arduino** receives the real-time WebSocket message, it:

   - Verifies that the `uuid` in the message is correct.
   - Extracts the relevant command from the JSON (or from the color adjustment data if in RGB mode).

2. The **Arduino** triggers the **IR transmitter** (or equivalent hardware) to control the LED strip or perform the indicated action.

3. **Completion**: The process is complete.

#### _MVP only supports the following remote controller due to IR code compatibility_

## Security and Trade-offs

- **Arduino UUID + PIN**

  - Simple, but vulnerable to **replay attacks** if intercepted.
  - **No** advanced encryption or token-based mechanism in the MVP.
  - In a real environment, this would be replaced with or complemented by **Cognito** or **JWT** for robust authentication/authorization.

- **S3 Access Controls**

  - Bucket is **private**, not publicly accessible.
  - **Server-Side Encryption (SSE)** ensures data at rest is encrypted.

- **IAM Policies**

  - The Lambda role has **minimum** required permissions to read/write DynamoDB, put objects to S3, and use `postToConnection` on API Gateway.

- **Public Subnet**
  - All services are in a public subnet for simplicity.
  - Long term, a private subnet with NAT Gateway or VPC Endpoints would be more secure.

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **AWS Cognito Integration**

   - Replace `(uuid, pin)` with Cognito-based JWT tokens for robust identity and access management.
   - Secure the Arduino–backend communication with short-lived tokens.

2. **Encrypted PIN or Other Credentials**

   - Store `pin` in a **hashed** format in DynamoDB to limit damage if compromised.

3. **Device Registration Portal**

   - Allow users to register new Arduino devices in a self-service manner, possibly with a more advanced provisioning flow.

4. **Lifecycle Policies in S3**

   - Automatically purge older audio/JSON data after X days to reduce storage costs and limit potential exposure of PII.

5. **Private Subnets & VPC**
   - Move Lambda and other services to private subnets with VPC endpoints for tighter security.
