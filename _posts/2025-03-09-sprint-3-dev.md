What an incredible week for our little team! We've made massive strides across all fronts, particularly in backend development where we've nearly wrapped up all core functionality. Let's dive into what each of us has accomplished this sprint.

## Sunho's Backend Progress

I made huge progress this week with a major milestone for our backend infrastructure! I nearly completed all functionality development and set up an automated deployment pipeline. Here's what I pulled off:

### Lambda Functions Development & Optimization

- **Pattern to AI Lambda** (the one we renamed from "Surprise Me"): I got this working beautifully - it now analyzes user history from DynamoDB to spot patterns and recommend light settings without the user having to ask. The system smartly sends these recommendations straight to the Arduino device.
- **DynamoDB & Orchestration Lambda Updates**: I modified our existing lambda (now called "Audio to AI") to store important metadata in DynamoDB, giving us a persistent record of user interactions. The table uses UUID as partition key and DAY#TIME as sort key, storing everything from emotion tags to light settings and context.
- **Refactoring for Speed**: I spotted duplicated code across our lambdas and pulled out the common bits into a new "Result Save Send" lambda that handles database storage and Arduino communication. This move lets the original lambda return responses to the frontend immediately without waiting.
- **WebSocket Connection Handling**: I refined how we store WebSocket connection IDs mapped to UUIDs in DynamoDB, properly handling connections on $connect and cleaning them up on $disconnect.

### Lambda Function Orchestration Pattern

I spotted duplicated code in multiple Lambda functions (`audio_to_ai` and `pattern_to_ai`). Both functions shared similar post-processing after receiving AI responses. So I pulled out the common bits into a new "Result Save Send" lambda that handles database storage and Arduino communication. This move lets the original lambda return responses to the frontend immediately without waiting to save the result to the database and send it to arduino.

- Used article [Are We Making Lambda Too Hard?](vscode-file://vscode-app/Applications/Visual%20Studio%20Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) for guidance

The new workflow architecture works like this:

1. **First-stage Lambdas** (`audio_to_ai`, `pattern_to_ai`):
   - Handle authentication
   - Prepare input for AI processing
   - Validate AI responses
   - Return quick results to frontend
   - Asynchronously invoke second-stage Lambda
2. **Second-stage Lambda** (`result_save_send`):
   - Process and parse AI responses
   - Store data in S3 and DynamoDB
   - Retrieve IR codes from DynamoDB
   - Send commands to Arduino devices via WebSockets
   - Handle all backend processing without blocking user response

This approach gives us:

- **Reduced cold start time**: Smaller import footprint in each Lambda
- **Improved user experience**: Faster response times to frontend
- **Better modularity**: Easier maintenance and future feature additions
- **More efficient resource utilization**: Processing-heavy tasks run asynchronously

### DynamoDB Query Patterns & Sort Keys

- Learned how to use composite sort keys in DynamoDB by concatenating values with delimiters (e.g., `DAY#3#TIME#14:30`)
- This approach enables efficient range-based queries while maintaining a simple table structure
- For our project, created a `DAY#TIME` sort key pattern to enable time-based pattern analysis

The application uses this pattern to query user activity by time ranges:

### Infrastructure as Code Implementation

- Successfully implemented Terraform for managing AWS infrastructure
- Created GitHub Actions pipeline for automated deployment
- Set up environment variables and secrets management

### CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

- I successfully hooked up Terraform with GitHub Actions to create a smooth CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment.

### IAM Management Learning

- Created IAM policies with specific permissions for each resource type
- Used Terraform to define and attach policies to roles
- Implemented least-privilege principle for security

### Known Issues

- Pipeline doesn't automatically detect Lambda code changes that require new ZIP file creation
- Local testing properly updates ZIP files and detects changes, but CI/CD pipeline needs improvement

### Next Moves:

- Fix that pipeline issue where lambda function changes aren't automatically caught (I still have to manually update the zip files, which is annoying)
- Run full integration testing with the frontend
- Work on Arduino code for automatic WebSocket API Gateway connection
- Implement LED setting state initialization
- Update the frontend pipeline for Next.js compatibility

## Taemin's Frontend Progress

Taemin has built all the foundational components we need for user interaction. She's focused on getting working logic first, with plans to make everything look pretty in later sprints:

### Progress from Sprint 2

1. **Device Registration Page**

   - Built a clean UI for users to enter their **UUID** and **PIN**
   - Used React **useState** to manage form data with controlled input fields
   - Added validation to make sure inputs follow the right format before submission
   - Stored UUID and PIN in **local state** so we can use them in API requests

2. **Audio File Submission (POST Request)**

   - Created a **POST request** function that sends data to the backend
   - The request includes:
     - `UUID`
     - `PIN`
     - `Audio file (binary)`
   - Used the **FormData API** to handle file uploads properly
   - Made sure the backend can receive and process the request correctly

### React Concepts Taemin Learned & Applied

- **useState Hook:** For managing form data and controlled inputs
- **Handling File Uploads:** Using FormData to send audio files efficiently
- **Asynchronous API Calls:** Implementing fetch requests with async/await
- **Event Handling in Forms:** Adding event listeners for form submission
- **Component Reusability:** Structuring form inputs as reusable components

### Questions & Decisions

- Do we need to encrypt the **UUID & PIN** before sending?
  - **Decision:** No, since this is an MVP. Encryption would need complex backend work, and we're focusing on getting the AI to control the LED light. We'll add encryption in a later version.
- Should we use **local storage** to remember the UUID/PIN between sessions?
  - **Decision:** Yes, since we're skipping logout functionality for now, local storage will let the web app remember the UUID and PIN. We'll need to add a "Log Out" page later so users can enter different credentials if needed.
- How will the WebSocket connection handle **multiple users**?
  - **Decision:** The frontend will send the UUID with each WebSocket request. The backend will store active connections in DynamoDB and use the connection ID to route responses to the right user.

### Taemin's Goals for Sprint 4

- **Convert to Next.js** for better pipeline monitoring and API handling
- **Build the "Surprise Me" Feature** that generates AI-driven responses
- **Implement a WebSocket Status Button** to show real-time connection updates
- **Check AWS API Gateway Logs** to make sure requests are reaching the backend
- **Add a Reset Button** to reset the RGB color code for the LED light

### WebSocket Status Implementation Plan

- Use useState to track WebSocket connection status
- Establish connection when component mounts
- Show real-time WebSocket status in the UI
- Handle incoming messages to update status dynamically
